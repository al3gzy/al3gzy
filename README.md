# 👽 About Me

I'm a student of Applied Mathematics - Data Science pursuing a BSc at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad. Interested in the **computational physics**, with specific focus on **quantum dynamics** and **machine learning**.

Currently, I exploring Quantum AI models for biotechnology, so stay tuned. 🧬

Starting MSc Mathematical Engineering - Advanced Quantum Engineering @ PoliMi in September 2025.
