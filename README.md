# 👽 About Me

I'm a Applied Mathematics - Data Science student pursuing a BSc at Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad. Interested in the **computational physics**, with specific focus on: quantum dynamics, chaos theory, stochastic processes, functional analysis, machine learning and optimisation.. Currently, I am combining PINNs, PINO and FNO into **HyPINO-F** model for magnetic field orientation in Bloch-Torrey equations.
