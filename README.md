# üëΩ About Me

I'm a student of Applied Mathematics - Data Science pursuing a BSc at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad. Interested in the **computational physics**, with specific focus on **quantum dynamics** and **machine learning**.

Currently, I am exploring **quantum-inspired AI** models for biotechnology, so stay tuned. üß¨

Starting **MSc Mathematical Engineering - Advanced Quantum Engineering** @ PoliMi in September 2025.
